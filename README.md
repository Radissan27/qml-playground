## How to create a project
I haven't figured out how to work with CMake settings regarding Qt in order to add my QML files so the only way to create a project is via Qt Creator as follows:
1. Create Project
2. Projects: Application(Qt) | Qt Quick Application
3. Enter name and location
4. :exclamation:Make sure the "Create a project that you can open in Qt Design Studio" checkbock is NOT checked
5. Select minimum version of Qt
6. Select MinGW 64-bit kit
7. Add to version control: None

Now you can work on the project either from Qt Creator or VS Code and it will behave the same.
